        <pre>         <h2>“Super Deluxe” Breakdown</h2></pre>
        <br>
        1 – The movie kick starts with the conversation of Vaembu (Sam) and Kannamma (The EX). Sam is the one who makes
        the call to EX, so understand that it was her primal urge that made her call him. The proof for this
        understandable from the way she invites him over and also the tone of her voice. EX says that he has “borrowed a
        lot of money from gangsters and cannot payback” to them anymore and that’s been troubling him for some time.
        Remember this, we’ll get back to it later. The conversation ends with EX agreeing to come over to Sam’s.
        <br>
        2 – The shot opens to Sam straddling EX, with a very high pitched sound of ecstasy in the background (from a
        Radio, probably) blending in with the mood of that scene. They are having sex. But EX is constantly thinking
        about that money and the gangsters. And then, dies. Observe the train sound in the background.
        So, technically the movie opens with a sex scene.
        <br>
        3 – Here, watch how that undergarment is hanged on the hanger. In the form of an “8”. This is completely silly
        and funny and might feel not at all necessary, but believe me, it is referenced again later in the film.

        <br>
        4 – The boys don their 3D glasses and are ready for their feast. As I have already mentioned about the ‘red’
        and/or ‘blue’ tints/colours in the film, here, it means the film that we are watching (in real life) is a
        parallel to what the boys are about to watch (in reel life). And we, the audience watching the film are
        metaphorically represented as these boys. It’s meta-meta-cinematic.

        <br>
        5 – We get introduced to Arputham and Ramasamy. Listen carefully to what Ramasamy says to the devotees. He tells
        that, not until six months ago, he couldn’t even “talk” and now, it’s Arputham that prayed to their Sea God and
        gifted him his voice. Remember this.

        <br>
        6 – When Mugil utters the f-word by mistake, the kid picks it up and keeps on reciting it like a poem. Look at
        the way the old man reacts to it. Feeling very uncomfortable. He even calls it “An act of sin”, such a typical
        reply. Just saying…

        <br>
        7 – You see that train engine in the background, remember where you heard it before? Yes. It’s the same train
        whose sound we hear when EX dies on Vaembu’s bed. So, TK has established that all these acts are happening
        parallely.

        <br>
        8 – Observe the clock on the wall. It reads 6:50 AM. Very early in the day. Yet another proof attributing to the
        fact that Mugil is on his way back to home from acting class while Vaembu was having some fun with EX.

        <br>
        9 – This scene is very important. See that TV showing an Alien kind of pointing towards the screen and opposite
        to it is Gaaji, starting at something else. This is the very first time we see any Alien reference and is also
        foreshadowing for what will happen with Gaaji and that Alien we see at the very end.

        <br>
        10 – Idi Ameen only cautions them not to get too close to the “liquid” and asks them to drop 4 drops into some
        guy’s “tea”. He never really says how this so called poison works. That’s TK’s advantage. Will get back to it
        later.

        <br>
        11 – While the bed and body flies down the building, the BGM scored here is a clever Indian mridangam-sannai
        styled rendition of the classic Star Wars theme. Why Star Wars only? Will answer this in a bit.

        <br>
        12 – In this scene, we overhear a TV host and some other person discussing about Aliens. It’s the very first
        direct reference to aliens. The person also raises a doubt, as you can read in the captions below. Also see how
        TK cleverly plot-blocks and teases us to wait and watch to get the answer to the question of that person on TV.
        This very same TV show could be the one we briefly see earlier, in that TV repair shop those boys visit.





        <br>
        13 – Ramasamy talking about his “legs” now. Pointing out at the uncertainty in his belief that Arputham is
        really a chosen one and their God actually exists.

        <br>
        14 – This is the first direct reference of Star Wars and the second reference overall. There must be some
        serious connection between this film and Star Wars, mustn’t it? We’ll find out.


        <br>
        15 – This frame is pretty much the whole film summed up. If you’ve watched the film already, you can find the
        whole story in this very frame. There’s a direct reference to Ridley Scott’s “Aliens” film, posters all over the
        wall, amongst many other Hindi and regional Tamil films. There’s this poster of a woman in bare back, kinda
        giving vibes of some porn flick. Remember this, we will need it later. Do not forget to observe the
        surroundings.

        <br>
        16 – Here, it is clear how this shopkeeper believes that donating money to transgenders and receiving their
        blessing is a very good thing. It’s just a belief.
        Some believe it, some don’t. We’ll know why this scene is crucial.

        <br>
        17 – So, you thought this plane has something to do with the ending of the film? No. It has nothing to do with
        anything in the film. It’s just a distraction that TK added to confuse us. And also a ploy for the camera to
        rotate over it’s head so that the actors can cross path, because it’s a single shot. And also, that bare back
        lady is back in the poster, again.


        <br>
        18 – See that phrase “Magic Event” written on the wall. It’s important. Make a note.

        <br>
        19 – The same lane which Vijay and Raasu Kutti cross a few minutes ago. You can see more clearly, those posters
        and the industry chimneys behind.

        <br>
        20 – These lines from Gaaji and Mugil respectively are actually true philosophies that TK touches upon, at the
        end of the film. Also observe how EX in the background is placed exactly in the middle of this couple and also
        there’s a key hanging right in front of him. It’s foreshadowing of how this guys death will eventually bring
        this couple closer. The “key” to their relationship.


        <br>
        21 – The constable wears a blue mufti to go to Raasu Kutti’s house for inquiry. Remember this.

        <br>
        22 – Dos that dialogue ring any bells? For those who don’t, it’s written by Christopher Nolan and you can hear
        it multiple times in Interstellar. Yet another space-bulk beings related movie reference from TK. Interesting.
        Where is he going with this?

        <br>
        23 – The underwear story comes a full circle here, as already pointed out in point 3. TK here is just trying to
        point out, no matter how different you think you are from the rest of the world, things you do always resemble
        the same. He explains that with something as trivial as an undergarment. Like there are “patterns” to everything
        in this world. This theme resonates again later in the film.


        <br>
        On a side note, this 3 mins 30+ secs long single take is the best scene in the whole film. The way Ramya
        Krishnan gaaru portrays a plethora of emotions all through, it’s fantastic.
        <br>
        24 – The wise words this old woman speaks is yet another theme that TK dwells upon in this film. It’s “layered”
        writing.


        <br>
        25 – See that guy with the beard. That is our EX, the one who dies in the first scene. Also observe that there
        is a tea cup beside him, which indicates that he might’ve been poisoned by the gangsters, for he did not pay up
        the money he borrowed from them. Remember, Idi Ameen did not say how exactly the poison works, in point 10. So
        this is how TK utilizes that fact. Idi Ameen might be the one who might’ve poisoned the EX as he did not pay up,
        which set forward the events that follow Vaembu and Mugil.

        <br>
        26 – Searching for Raasu Kutti, Shilpa gets into the TV repair shop just beside the one in which EX was sitting.
        It’s a physical metaphor stating that Shilpa (the thread) is intertwining the stories of EX and the boys (TV
        shop) with his story and that they ultimately lead to one end.

        <br>
        27 – Remember I told about that “Magic Event” phrase, in point 18. Well, it’s back. And see what TK has done in
        the very next second.
        See! You see that! TK just used VFX to write “Real Life” above that and is telling us that this particular
        episode will be the reason why this whole story runs. A life changing magical event! Life changing for pretty
        much everyone on board in this story. Just think about it, had this “magical disappearance of Raasu Kutti” does
        not happen, Shilpa wouldn’t have lost her cool, wouldn’t have gone to the police and cursed Berlin to “die”,
        wouldn’t even have met Arputham in a sub-way and plant this seed that “it was just a rock” in his head. It’s a
        truly genius move from TK.


        <br>

        28 – See, how Berlin reacts to the bribing attempt by Mugil. He doesn’t care for money and is always craving for
        his basic instinct. This can be connected to the trailer of this film in a way, which I will talk about later.
        <br>

        29 – This is the same constable we see earlier who changes into a mufti, to inquire at Raasu Kutti’s place. He
        did not change his outfit and also, Arputham says all this happened “yesterday”, so that’s the proof that
        Shilpa’s events happen on Day 1 which, in a “magical” way, help move forward the other interlinked events that
        happen on Day 2.

        <br>
        30 – On the radio, you can hear the announcer telling the supposed back story of those diamonds that Arputham
        finds hidden away in that “God of Sea” statue. You see the odds of some random statue being shipped from
        someplace far off West has landed in Arputham’s place, after getting lost in sea for years. So much for
        “crossing paths”, TK explores it at the end.

        <br>
        31 – The moment she appears before them, you can hear some kind of static-frequency tuning sound which is a
        clear hint about the fact that the immediate conversation that they have is on some kind of a “communication of
        thoughts” or “telekinesis” of some sorts.
        <br>

        32 – She says that “YOU HAVE changed the senses into six, but there are far more in REALITY”, which is not just
        a line. It has a lot of information in it. Remember that overhearing TV conversation I talked about in point 12.
        That might actually be true. Because this alien here says that YOU changed how YOU perceive senses as only six
        while in REALITY, there are more. The very first example of that is the “communication of thoughts” that she
        gives us a sample of. So, aliens have been living amongst the humans and have been observing us. And they are
        far more advanced than us and might have helped us here and there to evolve beyond ourselves.
        <br>

        33 – See how Gaaji, unlike the other two, reacts to the alien in a lot calmer way. Which is uncalled for, for
        any human. Even to that “slipper slap” from Idi Ameen, he takes it like he has earned it or something. Like he’s
        owning his mistakes. This corroborates to the fact that its his virtues that make him the chosen one to stay
        with the alien and also that’s what makes her like him, maybe.
        <br>
        34 – She can’t even confidently say that she is an alien, for she gives this explanation. It directly supports
        that person’s theory on the TV show in point 12. And that jibe about aliens only visiting America, hilarious!
        <br>

        35 – The fact that her friend died a few minutes ago and that it did not affect her emotionally, just tells you
        how they perceive feelings differently from humans, if they have anything like that. And also, it’s a pure
        philosophical take by TK, stating that “Death is quite unpredictable, but is quite certain.”
        <br>
        36 – All through this replication process, listen carefully, you can hear that radio-frequency-tuning sound
        gradually getting louder and louder. That’s what that alien might’ve used to replicate him.

        <br>

        37 – And the ball drops!
        What? You didn’t get it?
        What does Gaaji say? “May you be with the force!”
        What’s the famous Star Wars tagline? “May the force be with you!”
        Connected the dots, yet?
        This alien is one of those hundreds of Space Creatures that we have seen all through the Star Wars movies. That
        is the reason why we’ve been hinted the Star Wars references all through, but not from the boys. This is the
        very first reference from their scenes and Gaaji says to his replica to be “with the FORCE”. So, I connect that
        line in this way. But…
        But….
        How did Gaaji know about the alien’s origins when she herself does not know, you may ask. That could be because
        Gaaji does not know it for sure, but is only a calculated guess from HIS knowledge of the MOVIES he saw. The
        influence of movies on him is hinted in the first act where he talks about “Kill Bill”. And that might also tell
        us he might’ve watched Star Wars, obviously. And this might JUST be his way of coming to peace with where that
        alien belongs. Hence, he also reacts to her in a very calm way. Like how people in Star Wars movies just get
        along with talking monkeys and what not, without getting surprised or shocked.
        <br>

        38 – See that TV cover bears the phrase “Flying Monkeys”. It is a nod to the fact that these 3 boys are Flying
        Monkeys of the goon Idi Ameen, who have gone to great lengths to get out of the situation they fell into.
        <br>

        39 – At this exact moment, you can hear an aeroplane flying by. We don’t get to see it, yet.
        <br>

        40 – Here we get the full disclosure as to why these boys wanted to bunk school that day. Though each and every
        person in the film contributes some or the other thing to the story, the root causes are the important ones,
        right?
        <br>

        41 – See that movie poster to the left of the frame. Seen it somewhere, right? Yes, it’s the same poster that I
        told you to remember about in point 15. From here, TK starts pulling off that “blanket” from under us. All
        through this monologue of Gaaji, he’s explaining to them about THIS film, the one we are watching. It’s
        completely meta-cinematic.
        This is what TK has been trying to establish right from the start. All of these intertwined events leading to
        this meta cinematic-real life crescendo of philosophy.

        <br>


        42 – We get a lot better look at the poster now.
        Also, Gaaji says that the film gives a verbal description and meaning of what it is in the start itself and then
        get’s into the act, which is exactly opposite to what we are SEEING.
        Super Deluxe is what happens first and the exposition scene comes in the very end.
        <br>

        43 – The clock on the extreme right reads 8:35, which means that the other events that we are seeing have been
        happening simultaneously. All in a span of 2-3 hours tops. As told earlier, only Shilpa’s events happen a day
        before.

        <br>
        On yet another side note. Though Sam was fantastic all through, this sequence especially is so so fabulously
        performed. She was literally under the skin of Vaembu. Terrific acting on display here. Savor it!
        <br>
        44 – Now we get to see that aeroplane. This one has nothing to do with the one we are shown earlier. The other
        was just a ploy, as already told. This one connects to the sound we hear in point 39.

        <br>
        45 – The monologue that starts here, from the Doctor, is that “blanket” in TK’s arsenal, that I’ve been talking
        about.

        <br>

        46 – Right at the moment when the doc says that “life is thus being created through the art of sex” we get the
        reveal of Super Deluxe, at the right of the frame. It is either the name of an ice-cream joint…. or…

        <br>
        47 – See, the name is on top of a building. So… it could well be the name of a theater/cinema. The movie we are
        watching is Super Deluxe, in which there is a theater named Super Deluxe in which we get to watch a doctor
        explain the meaning of the film we are watching. Mind boggling stuff, right?

        <br>

        48 – This philosophical theme about all of being a part of one, despite being independent individuals, is very
        deep. The existence of True and False, Good-Bad, Day-Night, Male-Female, White-Black, etc. are clearly explained
        here. This is truly fantastic and downright ambitious writing!
        <br>

        49 – Or, Super Deluxe could only be the ice-cream joint’s name. Because we first see it on a TV commercial, as
        the title card. Then in that ice cream poster as in point 47 and Raasu Kutti and this guy are eating ice-creams
        at the very end of the film. So, this film having the same of an ice-cream bar brand could mean that “Enjoy it
        while it lasts..?”

        50 – Those words, “Vaazhvin Ragasiyam”, mean “The Secret of Life” which, according to TK here, is sex. The
        soundtrack that plays here is the same one which plays during the title reveal of Super Deluxe. So, Super Deluxe
        could also be an alternative title for “The Secret of Life”. Similar to the people in the story and to the
        philosophies it says, Super Deluxe in the name itself, is trying to be many things at the same time. But it’s
        one and the same after all, isn’t it?

        And, the movie ends right before the actors in Vaazhvin Ragasiyam, commit to the act of sex.
